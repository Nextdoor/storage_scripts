# Amazon-specific Storage Setup Script
#
# This script automatically sets up a /mnt volume on a host in the most
# efficient way possible based on the host type, underlying storage config,
# etc.
#
# This script is meant to be called by setup.sh, but can be called directly as
# well. Sane defaults are selected automatically, but settings can be
# overridden as well.
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
#   ENABLE_BCACHE
#     Set to "1" to enable the Block Cache with local SSD. Only applies
#     when using EBS storage as well.
#
#   BLOCK_SIZE
#     Set to any block size (in kbytes) to overwrite the default or
#     auto-detected block size.
#     
#   STORAGE_TYPE
#     Set to "ebs" to request EBS volumes as your primary backing store.
#
#   --- all options below only apply if STORAGE_TYPE=ebs ---
#
#   EBS_TYPE
#     "standard": General Magnetic Storage
#     "gp2": General Purpose SSD
#     "io2": Provisioned IOPS -- maxes out at 4000/volume
#
#   STORAGE_VOLCOUNT
#     The number of EBS volumes to create (total size will add up to
#     $STORAGE_SIZE)
#
#   STORAGE_SIZE
#     Number of gigabytes to provision in EBS storage.
